Users can be added to Tier Zero Code. When a user is added to Tier Zero Code, they can be either an internal user or an external user. There is a default administrative user object created on first startup through the "This C.O.D.E Server is Unclaimed" form.

When removing a user from Tier Zero Code, their account will be completely deleted, including all records referencing the user, such as logs. To retain user referenced records, we recommend suspending a user account, then visit the server admin panel to strip the user object permissions..
